# ðŸ”§ FIX VERCEL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE

## THE PROBLEM:
Your Vercel deployment has **Vercel Authentication** enabled, which blocks API access!

## âœ… SOLUTION - DISABLE VERCEL AUTHENTICATION:

1. **Go to Vercel Settings:**
   https://vercel.com/tysonso1122-2100s-projects/rvised/settings

2. **Click on "Deployment Protection"** in the left sidebar

3. **Under "Vercel Authentication":**
   - Toggle it **OFF**
   - Or set it to "Only Preview Deployments"

4. **Under "Password Protection":**
   - Make sure it's **OFF**

5. **Save Changes**

## ALSO ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

1. **Go to Environment Variables:**
   https://vercel.com/tysonso1122-2100s-projects/rvised/settings/environment-variables

2. **Add:**
   - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `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`
   - Select: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Click "Save"**

## THEN REDEPLOY:

After making these changes:
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete

## WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:
- Vercel Authentication blocks all API requests
- The extension can't access your API endpoints
- That's why you're getting "Authentication Required" errors

## AFTER FIXING:
Your extension will work perfectly with the Vercel deployment!
