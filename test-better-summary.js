Today I'm going to show you how to build apps that make real money.
The 1-minute rule is crucial - if your app solves a problem in under 60 seconds, you can charge up to $100 per year.
Look at Closer Coach and Scan Profit - they're perfect examples of this working.
For monetization, you need to achieve a 20% conversion rate from payment page viewers to actual purchasers.
This creates what I call the money printer effect.
Your focus should be on maximizing app downloads first, then optimizing conversions.

For marketing, influencer partnerships can rapidly expand your reach.
Find influencers in niche audiences with large followings.
Paid ads are powerful but require a minimum $5,000 budget and specific skills.
They can quickly boost your app visibility and user acquisition though.
Don't forget to optimize your app store listing - use compelling screenshots, a catchy tagline, and a memorable app name.

For development, I recommend Flutterflow for drag-and-drop app building.
Use Cursor for AI-driven customization.
Replet is great for web app development.
These tools let you create high-quality applications efficiently.

For analytics, Mix Panel is essential.
Use it to track user behavior, identify improvement areas, and make data-driven decisions.
This is how you optimize app performance and revenue.

Remember, personalization and re-engagement strategies across multiple channels are key.
You need to retain users and maintain their interest in your app.
